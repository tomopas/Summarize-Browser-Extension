# Summarize-Browser-Extension
Browser Extension for using AI to summarize Websites. This Browser Extension is for Chrome. I intended this Browser Extension to work with ollama GPT API but you would have to install it with npm which doesn't work with a browser extension. You will have to use a ChatGPT API Key (or change the api you are using in popup.js) and then go to the options page of the browser extension to enter your api key.
